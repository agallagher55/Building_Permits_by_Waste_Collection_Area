On behalf of Alanna Stockley in Solid Waste.

She originally submitted at task to calculate the number of dwelling units per Solid Waste Collection Area (TASK0212532).
I create a process in Model Builder to do the analysis.

Solid Waste would like a regular report sent to them with this data on a bi-annual basis. 
The report is okay to be sent in Excel and put in a folder location where Solid Waste staff have access. 

Could you convert the model builder process in python so that it can be automated? 
I have put the model in the toolbox located at T:\work\giss\monthly\202201jan\otoolel

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Lisa
